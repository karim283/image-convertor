# Image Converter App

This React application allows users to upload an image, convert it to absolute black and white, and optimize the converted image by resizing it.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload PNG or JPEG images.
- **Absolute Black and White Conversion**: Converts the uploaded image to a binary black and white format based on a threshold.
- **Image Optimization**: Resizes the converted image by entering a single value for both width and height.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a dynamic and interactive experience.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Used for image manipulation tasks, including conversion and resizing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application, enabling rapid design and responsive layouts.

## Code Structure

### Components:
- **App Component**: The main component that manages state and renders the application UI.

### State Management / State Variables:
- `image`: Stores the uploaded image as a base64 string.
- `convertedImage`: Holds the converted black and white image.
- `optimizedImage`: Contains the resized image after optimization.
- `size`: Represents the size value entered for optimization.

### Key Functions:

#### `handleImageUpload`:
- Triggered when an image is uploaded.
- Validates the file type and reads the file as a data URL to update the image state.

#### `convertToBlackAndWhite`:
- Creates a canvas element to draw the uploaded image.
- Processes the image data to convert it to absolute black and white based on a predefined threshold (128).
- Updates the `convertedImage` state with the resulting image.

#### `optimizeImage`:
- Resizes the converted image using a canvas based on the size value entered by the user.
- Updates the `optimizedImage` state with the resized image.

## User Interface

The UI is composed of:
- **Image Upload Section**: A section where the user can upload an image file.
- **Display Area**: Displays the uploaded image, the converted black and white image, and the optimized image.
- **Controls**: Buttons and inputs to trigger image conversion and optimization.

## CSS Styling

- **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling, enabling responsive design and quick component customization through utility classes.
- The application layout is responsive, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes.
